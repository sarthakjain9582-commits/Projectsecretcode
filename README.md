# Projectsecretcode
A fun Python program that converts normal text into a secret encoded language and back again! It uses a custom cipher algorithm to scramble letters, making messages unreadable to anyone who doesn't know the key. Perfect for learning basic cryptography and string manipulation in Python.

Features:

Encode: Transforms any input text into a secret version.
Decode: Reverses the process to reveal the original message.
Simple & Fun: A great project for beginners to understand loops, dictionaries, and functions.
More features coming up soon , looking forward for your suggestions
